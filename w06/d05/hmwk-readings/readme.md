## Week 7 Preview Homework

Congratulations on your successful Project 2!

Project 3 will be a group project using Javascript, Node.js, Express and MongoDB with Mongoose. This weekend, we'd like you to spend a few hours getting back up to speed with JS and preparing to work on a team project with GitHub.

### JS Review

Please install and run the workshop below from [nodeschool.io](nodeschool.io):

[Planet Proto](https://github.com/sporto/planetproto) Will 

Type `npm install -g planetproto@latest` to install, `cd` into the directory and type `planetproto` to begin.

This will re-introduce Javascript in a way that should provide a reasonable weekend challenge.
